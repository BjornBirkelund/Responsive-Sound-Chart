# Responsive-Sound-Chart

This is a chart which was my first ever project in React.js for SoundSensing

The point of this chart is to represent decibel values on a chart so that
* The data can update - responsive
* The Data is represented in a nice way
* There is a way to toggle through different time constraints such as day/week/month/year
