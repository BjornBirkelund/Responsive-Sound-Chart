## Responsive-Sound-Chart

This is a chart which was my first ever project in React.js for SoundSensing
In this project, I learned the basic work flow and necessities within React

The point of this chart is to represent decibel values on a chart so that:
* The data can update - responsive
* The Data is represented in a nice way
* There is a way to toggle through different time constraints such as day/week/month/year

### react-bootstrap

`npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

### react-rangeslider
